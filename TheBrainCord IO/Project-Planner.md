| Week | Module                         | Objective                                                                 | Deliverables                             |
|------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Introduction to IoT            | Understand IoT fundamentals, types of sensors, communication protocols.   | Notes, sensor list, comparison chart     |
| 2    | Microcontrollers               | Learn Arduino, ESP32 basics. Flash firmware, send data via serial.        | Blink LED, Serial Monitor Logs           |
| 3    | Sensor Interfacing             | Connect water level, DHT11, motion, light sensors to ESP32.               | Sensor read code, photos                 |
| 4    | Wi-Fi Communication            | Send sensor data to cloud (e.g. Firebase, MQTT broker).                   | Firebase dashboard, MQTT test            |
| 5    | Database Integration           | Learn to store data in Firebase/SQL, build data schema.                   | JSON structure, real-time dashboard      |
| 6    | Basic UI on Web                | Design a minimal dashboard to view sensor data (HTML + JS + Firebase).    | Web UI with data updates                 |
| 7    | AI Basics                      | Study ML basics (classification, anomaly detection).                      | Simple ML model with CSV data            |
| 8    | AI Integration Plan            | Plan where ML will help (e.g., auto alerts, water overflow prediction).   | ML pipeline sketch, model idea notes     |
| 9â€“12 | Phase-1 Mini Project (School)  | Deploy IoT dashboard for school water tanks, temp/humidity, motion.       | Working school-level system              |
| 13â€“14| Platform Design                | Modular codebase to connect multiple sensors and brands.                  | Folder structure, config files           |
| 15â€“20| Phase-2 Upgrade (Commercial)   | Add support for more sensors, AI config rules, mobile-first design.       | Scalable app & deployment-ready repo     |
