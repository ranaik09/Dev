# TheBrainCord IO 🌐🔌🤖

**A Unified IoT Integration Platform with AI Support**  
Built with ❤️ to connect ANY brand of IoT devices under a single modular interface, powered by AI insights and scalable web infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Vision

To empower smart environments (homes, farms, industries, institutions) using an **open-source**, customizable IoT-AI platform that:
- **Unifies** control of any hardware brand/device (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)
- **Integrates AI tools** to provide automation, safety alerts, and predictive actions
- Supports **remote configuration, OTA updates, and multi-user permissions**
- **Empowers students** with a practical development and deployment ecosystem

---

## 📁 Project Modules

- `device-drivers/`: Scripts for hardware (Arduino, ESP32, etc.)
- `backend/`: API & cloud logic (Firebase / FastAPI / Node.js)
- `frontend/`: Interface for control (React/Next.js with Tailwind)
- `ai-assistants/`: Automation + prediction modules
- `configs/`: Device, security, and cloud configs
- `tests/`: Functional and integration tests

## 📈 Goals by Phase

### 🧩 Phase 1: Core Device Integration
- Control devices via app dashboard
- Multi-device onboarding (WiFi + MQTT)
- Real-time data dashboard

### 🧠 Phase 2: AI Tool Integration
- Suggest use-cases based on sensor history
- Dynamic alerts and smart rules
- Voice and multilingual text-based UI
